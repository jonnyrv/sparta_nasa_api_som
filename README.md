# sparta_nasa_api_som
## Introduction
This set of work involves looking into understanding api, SOM(Service Object Model), how to use and access it in new ways and using all of this alongside rspec. Within this repo you will find examples of array, hash and json data usage and manipulation.
## Getting started
Simply clone the repository to your computer to get started with this rspec introduction. The rspec gem should be included with base Ruby. Checkout the rspec [documentation](https://relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/docs/built-in-matchers) to brush up on general use of rspec.
### Prerequisites
This was done in Ruby 2.4.0 older versions may not be compatible.
see [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38194032/how-to-update-ruby-version-2-0-0-to-the-latest-version-in-mac-osx-yosemite) for instructions on updating your Ruby version (on Mac)
## Running Tests
In general run the following command in your terminal to get the results of your rspec tests.
```
rspec file_name.rb
```
Or you could open the folder you just cloned in your terminal and run the command rspec.
```

## Built With
Ruby, rspec, httparty and json!
